Tiny little examples of node parsing some soap xml from safaricoms api... 

Its a koa server with one endpoint :/api

The endpoint just gets one xml example and parses it, the returns it in an exact json replica of everything in the xml as json 

```
$ git clone
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

in browser `curl localhost:8080`
or hit that with postman to see a pretty json res
